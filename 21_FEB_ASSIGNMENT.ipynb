    "ANS = Web scraping can be performed using various methods and techniques, depending on the complexity of the task and the structure of the target website. Here are some common methods and tools used for web scraping:\n",
    "\n",
    "Manual Copy-Pasting: The simplest form of web scraping involves manually copying and pasting data from a website into a spreadsheet or text document. This method is suitable for small-scale data extraction but is not practical for large or frequent scraping tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regular Expressions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Regular expressions (regex) can be used to extract specific patterns of text from web pages. This method is handy for extracting data that follows a consistent format, such as phone numbers or email addresses. However, it may not be suitable for more complex or structured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "HTML Parsing:\n",
    "\n",
    "HTML parsing libraries like Beautiful Soup (Python) or Cheerio (Node.js) are commonly used to scrape data from web pages. These libraries can parse the HTML structure of a webpage and extract specific elements, such as headings, paragraphs, links, and tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Web Scraping Frameworks:\n",
    "\n",
    "Several programming languages, such as Python and Node.js, have dedicated web scraping libraries and frameworks. For example, Python has libraries like Scrapy and Requests-HTML, which provide powerful tools for building web scrapers and handling HTTP requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "Headless Browsers:\n",
    "\n",
    "Headless browsers like Puppeteer (Node.js) or Selenium (Python and other languages) can automate web interactions by simulating a real user's interaction with a web page. They are useful when web scraping requires clicking buttons, submitting forms, or handling JavaScript-driven content.\n",
    "\n",
    "APIs:\n",
    "\n",
    "Some websites offer APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) that allow developers to access their data in a structured and controlled manner. When available, using an API is often the most reliable and ethical way to obtain data from a website. However, not all websites offer APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Extraction Tools:\n",
    "\n",
    "There are commercial and open-source data extraction tools and services that provide a user-friendly interface for scraping web data without the need for extensive programming. These tools may be suitable for users with limited technical skills.\n",
    "\n",
    "Proxy Servers:\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid IP blocking or rate limiting from websites, web scrapers can use proxy servers to make requests from different IP addresses, making it harder for websites to identify and block scraping activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scraping as a Service:\n",
    "\n",
    "Some companies offer web scraping as a service, where they maintain and run web scrapers for clients. These services provide access to pre-built scrapers and handle technical aspects like rotating IP addresses and managing scraping infrastructure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Web Scraping Libraries:\n",
